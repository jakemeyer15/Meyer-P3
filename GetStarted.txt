1. Choose an image by clicking the "Choose Image" button.
2. You will see the image you have selected appear on the 
    screen. You can now choose to pixelate the image in 
    three different variations(small, medium, or large) 
    or convert the image to 8-bit by selecting the radio
    buttons.
3. You can reset the image back to normal by selecting
    the reset button.

    Enjoy!
